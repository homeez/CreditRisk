# Credit Risk Analysis and Prediction

Welcome to the **Credit Risk Analysis and Prediction** repository! This project focuses on analyzing and predicting whether employees who obtain loans from an organization will default on their agreement to repay the loan. The dataset used in this project contains historical information about employees, including various features such as Income, Age, Loan amount, and a binary indicator for Default.

## Dataset

The dataset provided for this project includes the following columns:

- **Client ID:** A unique identifier for each employee/client.
- **Income:** The income of the employee.
- **Age:** The age of the employee.
- **Loan:** The amount of the loan obtained by the employee.
- **Default:** A binary column indicating whether the employee defaulted on the loan (1 for default, 0 for no default).

## Project Aim

The main objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately determine whether an employee will default on their loan repayment. To achieve this aim, the chosen model is the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. KNN is a suitable choice for this project because the problem involves predicting a quantitative output (default or no default) based on the characteristics of the employee.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-risk-analysis.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:** If there are any specific dependencies required for the project, you'll find them listed in the project's documentation.

3. **Explore the Dataset:** Take some time to explore the dataset and get familiar with its structure and content. This step will help you understand the features and the target variable (Default) that you'll be working with.

4. **Run the Code:** Follow the provided code examples and scripts to preprocess the data, train the KNN model, and evaluate its performance.

5. **Experiment and Improve:** Feel free to experiment with different preprocessing techniques, hyperparameters for the KNN model, and even consider trying other algorithms to compare performance.

6. **Contribute:** If you have ideas for improvements, bug fixes, or additional features, don't hesitate to contribute to the repository. Open a pull request and collaborate with others interested in the project.
